I'm a designer and developer who creates premium React components that you can drop straight into your projects. Each component is meticulously crafted with modern animations and clean design principles.

Check out my [portfolio](https://www.chetanverma.com/) to see my work, or if you need a full MVP developed, visit my solo dev agency [WebMakers Studio](https://www.webmakers.studio/) where I build MVPs starting at $1000. 💼

## What You'll Find 🎯

**Production-Ready Components** 🔧  
Every component is battle-tested and ready for real-world applications. No prototypes or proof-of-concepts here.

**Modern Animation Stack** 🎬  
Built with Framer Motion and GSAP for silky-smooth interactions that feel natural and responsive.

**Tailwind CSS Foundation** 🎨  
Utility-first styling that's easy to customize and maintain. Change colors, spacing, and typography with simple class modifications.

**Copy-Paste Simplicity** 📋  
No complex installations or configurations. Just copy the code and paste it into your React project.

## Why These Components Work 💡

**Designer's Eye** 👁️  
Each component is designed with attention to detail, proper spacing, and visual hierarchy that actually looks professional.

**Developer's Touch** 👨‍💻  
Clean, readable code that follows React best practices. TypeScript support included where it matters.

**Performance First** ⚡  
Optimized animations and minimal bundle impact. Your users will notice the smoothness, not the loading times.
